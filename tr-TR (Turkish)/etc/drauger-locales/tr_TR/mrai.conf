# Lines starting with "#" are treated as comments
# First coloumn is for where the line or word is used
# Second coloumn is the actual line or word	translated into the language you are working with.
# Coloumns should be seperated by a single tab
# Use "\n" where you think things need to be moved to a lower line and "\t" to tab things over
# Translations should be enclosed in dobule quotes (") in order to be parsed correctly
# Indicate where internal variables should be parsed in with "\v"
# Only lines which show a variable being used will use them. And they are required to be used.
# Do not use double quotes in your text. Use single quotes instead. This is to work around a bug
